# Mall Simulation Project

Welcome to the **Mall Simulation Project**, developed as part of the Computer Graphics course. This project showcases various advanced features and implementations in OpenGL 3.x, with a focus on realism, interaction, and programming efficiency.

## üî• **Key Features**

1. **Custom Models**

   - The majority of objects were modeled from scratch without using any pre-built models, except for trees, external buildings, and vehicles in the parking garage.

2. **Free Movement Camera**

   - Implemented a free camera system that allows smooth movement across the scene.

3. **Dynamic Interactions**

   - Doors, drawers, and cupboards can be opened or closed by pressing a single key when the player is near them.

4. **Realistic Water Animation**

   - Achieved realistic water movement inside pools and fountains to closely mimic real-life motion.

5. **Collision Detection**

   - Comprehensive collision detection is implemented to prevent the camera from passing through objects or walls.

6. **Lighting and Shadows**

   - External lighting with dynamic shadows for a more realistic atmosphere.

7. **Elevator System**

   - Functional elevator for seamless travel between the first and second floors.

8. **Interactive Audio**

   - Added sound effects for interactions to enhance the user experience.

9. **Pre-Built Libraries**

   - Utilized libraries to handle textures, sound effects, and other utilities.

10. **Object-Oriented Design**
    - The entire project is structured following object-oriented programming principles for maintainability and scalability.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kareem-Bizreh/Mall

```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the necessary libraries for textures, audio, and OpenGL. Refer to the [Important Things](Important%20Things) file in the repository for detailed instructions on downloading and adding these libraries.

### Step 3: Open the Project

Open the project using **Visual Studio 2022 (VS22)**.

### Step 4: Build the Project

Build the project using the **Build Solution** option in Visual Studio to ensure everything compiles correctly.

### Step 5: Run the Project

After building, run the project to explore the mall simulation and its interactive features.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- The project may not run on the first attempt. Please try running it multiple times.
- The initial run may take some time as images and sounds are loaded into RAM.

## üì¢ **Notes**

- This project relies on some additional libraries. Make sure to follow the [Important Things](Important%20Things) file to set everything up correctly.
- This project was created at **Damascus University**. To view the full project requirements, please refer to the file : [Computer-Graphics-Project-2024-2025.pdf](Computer-Graphics-Project-2024-2025.pdf) .
- **[Some Scenes](Some%20Scenes)**: Contains screenshots and scenes from the project.
- We hope you have an enjoyable experience exploring the project.
- For any issues or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute directly to the repository.
